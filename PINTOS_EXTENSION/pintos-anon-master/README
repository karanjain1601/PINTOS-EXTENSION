In order to run pintos on your system, we first need to check whether stropts.h is applicable or not.
Like in ubuntu20.04 pintos does not work. We implemented this project on ubuntu 18.04 .

Follow the steps to run pintos on ubuntu 18.04-
1. Install Qemu - $ sudo apt-get install qemu
2. Download Pintos - from our uploaded code
3. Unzip the code in the desktop.
4. Set GDBMACROS - Find the variable GDBMACROSin proj1/src/utils and set it to point to ‘$HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj1/src/misc/gdb-macros’.
Find the variable GDBMACROS in proj2/src/utils and set it to point to ‘$HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj2/src/misc/gdb-macros’.
5. Compile the Utilities - $ cd $HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj1/src/utils - then - $ make
$ cd $HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj2/src/utils - then - $ make
6. If you get an error saying “Undefined reference to ‘floor'”, make following changes:
Edit “Makefile” in the current directory and replace “LDFLAGS = -lm” by “LDLIBS = -lm” and redo the step for both proj1 and proj2.
7. Edit Make.vars in threads directory - Open the file “$HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj1/src/threads/Make.vars” and change the last line to:
SIMULATOR = –qemu
Open the file “$HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj2/src/threads/Make.vars” and change the last line to:
SIMULATOR = –qemu
8. Compile Pintos Kernel - cd $HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj1/src/threads - then - $ make
$ cd $HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj2/src/threads - then - $ make
9. Edit Pintos utiltiy
Make these three changes in “$HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj1/src/utils/pintos” :
On line no. 257, replace “kernel.bin” to path pointing to kernel.bin file at “$HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj1/src/threads/build/kernel.bin”.
Make these three changes in “$HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj2/src/utils/pintos” :
On line no. 257, replace “kernel.bin” to path pointing to kernel.bin file at “$HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj2/src/userprog/build/kernel.bin”.
10. Edit Pintos.pm file
Open “$HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj1/src/utils/Pintos.pm” and replace “loader.bin” at line no. 362 to path till loader.bin located at “$HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj1/src/threads/build/loader.bin”
Open “$HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj2/src/utils/Pintos.pm” and replace “loader.bin” at line no. 362 to path till loader.bin located at “$HOME/pintos-anon-master/proj2/src/userprog/build/loader.bin”
11. Add to PATH variable
pintos and other utilities are used to talk to Pintos. To run these utilities from any directory, add below mentioned line at the end of $HOME/.bashrc file and restart the terminal:
export PATH=$HOME/os-pg/pintos/src/utils:$PATH 
12. Now we you can go to any project folder in the terminal.
Now we compile the threads folder for the first project, then we enter the build file using $ cd build.
then we write the command $ make check VERBOSE=1. after its completion we execute the command $ make grade.
for project 2 we repeat the same steps as we did for project 1 but here we do it in userprog folder.
first we compile the userprog folder in proj2 , then we enter the build directory.
in the build directory we run the command $ make check VERBOSE=1 and after its completion we run $ make grade.
this will provide us with the grades recieved as per the stanford requirements.
